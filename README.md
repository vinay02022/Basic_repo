This project showcases a Node.js API that connects to two MongoDB databases—`employees_db` and `products_db`—to manage and retrieve employee and product data. It supports basic CRUD operations via RESTful endpoints. A combined API endpoint returns both datasets along with a summary. The server runs locally on port 3000 and is tested using tools like Postman or curl.
